## Description 

<p>  Facial/Ascoustic Sound Wave And Gesture Detection <b>FASGD-III</b> is a security application that performs the following which are: 

<ul>

<li> Facial Recognition </li>
<li> Sound Recognition </li>
<li> Gesture Recognition </li>


</ul>

</p>

<h3> Facial Recognition </h3>

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"> A facial recognition device is a device that takes an image or a video of a human face, and compares it to other images in a database. When using 
facial recognition, several pictures of the subject must have been taken at different angles and usually with different facial expressions then stored in a database. </p>

<h3> Sound Recognition </h3>

<p>  Sound recognition is ..... </p>


<h3> Gesture Recognition </h3> 

<p> Gesture recognition is .......  </p> 


<h3> Working Principle </h3> 

<p style="margin-left: 10px;"> In the security system, the facial recognition model is the first application to perform its functions, because the cameras exposed are always accepting frames from the outside world. 

The cameras which are positioned at specific areas, scans the face seen in view to make predictions on if the identified persons matches the trained facec stored in its database.

Thus, if the subject face has been registered on the system like that of the owner and it runs a scan nothing really happens. However, if the subject's face has not been registered on the security system and it runs a scan, this causes the system to either sound an alarm or send notification to the owner's mobile application.
